MiniProfiler Glimpse Plugin
============================

Important Notice
----------------

Miniprofiler v3.x introduced some changes that make the results unavailable when the request ends and the Glimpse data is collected so it can't work properly in future Miniprofiler versions.

BTW, Miniprofiler and Glimpse features mostly overlap, so I'm not using this plugin anymore because I don't find it useful.

If you know how to fix que Miniprofiler problems or find this plugin useful and want to add more features don't hesitate to make a pull request.

Description
-----------

This is a simple Glimpse plugin to show data collected by MvcMiniProfiler.

Usage
-----

Just reference the resulting MvcMiniProfiler.Glimpse.dll in your Glimpse-enabled project and will be automagically loaded using composition.

Support
-------

Create an issue here on GitHub, send me a message or fork the project and send me a pull request.
